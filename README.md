# SBG Preconstruction Bid Tracker

A full-stack rebuild of the **SBG Preconstruction Bid Tracker** (V20). The
original was a single self-contained HTML file that stored everything in
`localStorage`; this version splits frontend and backend, persists data in
SQLite, and keeps `localStorage` as an offline fallback so the app still works
when the API is down.

## Stack choices (and why)

**Backend: Node.js 20 + Express + better-sqlite3.**
The frontend is JavaScript, so a Node backend keeps everything in one language
and makes it trivial for anyone touching the UI to also touch the API. Express
is the smallest mainstream Node web framework -- the entire `routes.js` is
~150 lines. `better-sqlite3` is synchronous, very fast for the
single-tenant/small-team workload this app is sized for, and has zero
configuration: the database is just a file. SQLite is the perfect choice for a
preconstruction team's internal tool -- it backs up by copying a single file
and runs anywhere from a developer laptop to a $5 VPS.

**Frontend: vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no React rewrite).**
The original is one ~44k-line HTML file that's been carefully designed and
tested. Re-implementing it in React would be a multi-week effort with a high
risk of behavior drift. Instead the file is split into `index.html` +
`styles.css` + `app.js`, plus a 100-line `api.js` that adds the backend round
trips. The only behavioral change is that `loadState()` now also pulls from
the API after the first paint, and `saveState()` debounces a `PUT /api/state`
in addition to writing localStorage.

**Sync model: local-first with backend mirror.**
- On boot the UI reads localStorage -> renders immediately -> then asynchronously
  pulls `GET /api/state` and re-renders if the server has data.
- Every `saveState()` writes localStorage synchronously and schedules a
  debounced (500ms) `PUT /api/state` to sync the canonical copy.
- If the API is unreachable, the app keeps working entirely off localStorage --
  this matches the original's offline-friendly behavior and means the backend
  outage never blocks a user.

## Quick start

### Local development (single command)

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env             # optional -- defaults are fine
npm install
npm run migrate                  # creates ./data/sbg-tracker.db
npm run seed                     # seeds default stages, milestones, etc.
npm start                        # serves API at /api/* AND the frontend at /
```

Open http://localhost:3001 in a browser. The Express server serves the
frontend from `../frontend` by default (configurable via `STATIC_DIR`).

### Frontend-only mode (open the file directly)

If you just want the original single-page-app experience with no backend,
open `frontend/index.html` directly in a browser. The API health check will
fail and `api.enabled` flips to false; everything falls back to localStorage.

To explicitly disable backend sync, edit `frontend/index.html`:

```html
<meta name="api-enabled" content="false">
```

### Running tests

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

Tests use an in-memory SQLite database so they're hermetic and fast (~1s).

## REST API

All endpoints live under `/api`. JSON in, JSON out. CORS allowed origins are
configured via the `CORS_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated).

| Method | Path                                       | Purpose                                         |

| GET    | `/api/projects/:id/sub-bids`              | List imported sub bid rows                      |
| PATCH/DELETE | `/api/projects/:id/sub-bids/:bidId` | Update/remove one imported sub bid row       |

The frontend uses the coarse `/api/state` endpoint for everything; the
fine-grained entity endpoints exist for integrations, scripts, and future UI
that needs server-side validation per write.

## Sub bid email intake

Estimators can forward subcontractor bid PDFs to a mailbox such as
`bids@sourcebuild.net`. In a project, the "Sub Bid Inbox" panel can poll that
mailbox, send each PDF to Claude, attach the original PDF to the project, and
append a bid-tab row with sub name, trade, total, exclusions, qualifications,
and review status.

Required backend env:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
BID_INTAKE_IMAP_HOST=outlook.office365.com
BID_INTAKE_IMAP_USER=bids@sourcebuild.net
BID_INTAKE_IMAP_PASSWORD=...
```

Manual project-level polling does not require a subject convention. Optional
auto-polling (`BID_INTAKE_AUTO_POLL=1`) should use subjects like
`[SBG:<projectId>] Project Name - sub bid` or set
`BID_INTAKE_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID` during a single-project bid day.

## CI/CD

Three workflows are wired up in `.github/workflows/`:

- **`backend-ci.yml`** -- runs `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, `npm run migrate`
  (against an in-memory DB), and `npm test` on every push and PR that
  touches `backend/`.
- **`frontend-ci.yml`** -- HTML structural validation + an acorn-based
  syntax check on `app.js` and `api.js`.
- **`pages-deploy.yml`** -- publishes `frontend/` to GitHub Pages on every
  push to `main`. If a repository **variable** named `API_BASE` is set, the
  deployed site points at it; otherwise backend sync is auto-disabled so the
  Pages site works as a pure-localStorage demo.

### Backend hosting on AWS EC2

A complete deploy path is wired up in `deploy/aws/` and
`.github/workflows/backend-deploy.yml`. It targets a free-tier
`t3.micro` instance and auto-deploys on every push to `main`.

Walkthrough: [`docs/aws-setup.md`](docs/aws-setup.md).

Summary:
- `deploy/aws/user-data.sh` -- pasted into EC2 "User data" at launch.
  Installs Node, clones the repo, runs migrations, starts the systemd unit.
- `deploy/aws/sbg-tracker.service` -- systemd unit that runs the backend
  under a dedicated `sbg` user with auto-restart.
- `deploy/aws/Caddyfile` -- optional reverse proxy for free Let's Encrypt HTTPS.
- `.github/workflows/backend-deploy.yml` -- SSHes into EC2 on push and runs
  pull + npm ci + migrate + systemctl restart. Requires three repo secrets
  (`AWS_HOST`, `AWS_USER`, `AWS_SSH_KEY`).

Cost: $0 for 12 months under AWS free tier; ~$8/month afterwards. The same
artifacts work on any Linux host (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, your own server) --
just adapt the SSH details.
